    "# Meat Smoker Temperature Controller Project using Raspberry Pi Zero W \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a project to control the temperature of a meat smoker used for smoking delicious meats.\n",
    "Without this the temperature control is a very manual process requiring lots of blowing and inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/meat_smoker.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts Required\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Raspberry Pi Zero W (Adafruit for 10 bucks!) https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400\n",
    "2. MAX31855 thermocouple driver breakout board (Bangood) (2)\n",
    "3. type K thermocouples (2)\n",
    "4. TB6612FNG motor H-bridge controller breakout board (Bangood) (2)\n",
    "5. SD card and reader\n",
    "6. hookup wire\n",
    "7. USB power supply for the Zero W\n",
    "8. 12V plugpack for the blower fan\n",
    "9. 12V blower fan \n",
    "10. HVAC tape to connect the blower fan to the meat smoker\n",
    "11. enclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "## RPI Zero W setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The Raspberry Pi Zero W is pretty sweet as it:\n",
    "- allows headless connection\n",
    "- Raspbian OS choice is full of pre-installed functionality\n",
    "- headers for electronic projects\n",
    "- is cheap - only 10 bucks!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it was chosen as the MCU for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick setup description.  There are loads of support for install and setup, here is a link and summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/raspberry-pi-zerow-headless-wifi-setup.html\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.techrepublic.com/videos/video-how-to-set-up-your-raspberry-pi-zero-wireless/\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the steps I used to perform the setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download Raspbian stretch https://howchoo.com/g/ndg2mtbmnmn/how-to-install-raspbian-stretch-on-the-raspberry-pi\n",
    "2. Burn the image to the SD card using Etcher https://www.balena.io/etcher/\n",
    "3. add the .conf and ssh files for your Wifi \n",
    "4. Power the RPi (headless mode ie no monitor) after installing SD card\n",
    "5. Use PuTTY or similar to SSH into the RPi (raspberrypi.local)\n",
    "6. Update the hostname after SSH (sudo raspi-config) *important to avoid your WiFi network getting p30wn3d\n",
    "7. in the configuration UI, enable VNC, SPI, I2C and remote GPIO - this is now a hardware beast\n",
    "8. download VNC and create a user profile\n",
    "9. Enter the RPi using VNC in headless mode. \n",
    "10. Click on Python on the RPi and you are ready to roll!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware connections & Control\n",
    "\n",
    "The RPi connects via SPI to the motor driver breakout board (actuator)  and two thermocouples (sensors).\n",
    "The motor driver connects to a blower fan to heat/cool the hot coals in the smoker, or switch off and let the coals generate heat. This is a simple blower (P) control with digital output of the fan based on the sensed difference between pit and meat.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thermocouple is connected to the hot coals (pit), and the other inserted into the meat to be cooked (use hygiene!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip: The Bangood thermocouple breakout board has an incorrect connection! the sense- is connected to ground and must be removed with a Stanley knife or similar.  Many young paduans died to bring you this tip.  Without this you will not get a reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "I connected the pins as GPIO SPI.\n",
    "therm1\n",
    "CLK25\n",
    "CS24\n",
    "DO18\n",
    "\n",
    "therm2\n",
    "CLK16\n",
    "CS19\n",
    "DO26\n",
    "\n",
    "The blower fan is connected to the output pins of the motor driver and the 12V supply also soldered to the Vdd.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then attach the fan to the meat smoker with HVAC tape and you are good to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "And don't forget to put it in a box... or not\n",

    "details of the circuit connections are in the other photos in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a super simple P controller using the difference between setpoint and actual temperatures to activate the fan.\n",
    "Code included in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ready to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Plug the thermocouples into the pit and the meat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fire up the coals old school style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power up the Raspberry Pi Zero W.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should hear the blower start up and then stop as the meat comes up to temp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy your meat!\n",
